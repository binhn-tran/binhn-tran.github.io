## A Childhood Spark: My Journey into Technology and Troubleshooting
Ever since I was a kid, I have always been curious about how the world revolves around technology. My curiosity began in elementary school when I got my first laptop. As soon as I received it, I became fascinated by how computers work and always wanted to learn more about them. As time went on, I would run into minor issues with my laptop, and figuring out how to troubleshoot was enjoyable for me. If I couldn't find the solution on my own, I would always turn to YouTube for answers.

## Trial, Error, and Growth
Going into my first year of college, I had no prior experience with coding, so I spent hours practicing. I also attended office hours, where I met with the TA to get extra help. I wish I had started exploring Computer Science sooner because I struggled a lot in my programming classes. I found it difficult to understand many of the concepts being taught. Overtime, I began to grasp some concepts, but there are still many that I don’t fully understand. One of the TAs once told me that Computer Science is a broad field with many available resources, but it's up to me to explore opportunities by networking with others in the industry.

## Interests: Cybersecurity, AI, and Software Engineering
As I progressed in Computer Science, I developed a strong interest in Cybersecurity, Artificial Intelligence, and Software Engineering. My interest in cybersecurity comes from seeing reports of major corporations suffering from cyberattacks, which made me want to pursue a career where I could help protect the world from threats. As for artificial intelligence, I have been using it for a while, and I find it to be an incredibly useful resource. For software engineering, I am still learning about what it has to offer, but so far, the experience has been positive and a valuable learning journey.


## Determination to Become a Better Programmer
Currently, I am taking a software engineering class, which has been quite a rollercoaster. Even though I still struggle with picking up some concepts, I try my best to practice as much as I can because I know I won’t get anywhere without consistent effort. I hope to eventually master more programming languages so that I can work on my own projects. Although I may face challenges and hit roadblocks, I will continue striving toward my goal of becoming a proficient programmer.

## AI Use
I used AI to fix my grammar, the title for my technical essay, and for the titles of the paragraphs.
