## I. Introduction

Artificial intelligence is quickly transforming the landscape of education. It offers new possiblities for personalized learning, real-time feedback, and enhanced productivity. AI empowers both students and educators to focus more on problem solving. In Software Enginnering, the integration of AI tools is important because it bridges the gap between knowledge and application. AI has assisted me in many ways from debugging code, to helping me understand complex concepts, and as well as improving my code quality.

## II. Personal Experience with AI

Throughout my academic experience and in ICS 314, AI tools have played a role in supporting my learning process. It has helped me understand key software engineering principles, write better code, and navigate complex problems more efficiently. The AI tools that I've utilized includes ChatGPT, Claude AI, and GitHub Copilot.

  1. Experience WODs: When I would begin the WODs, I would first start off by doing it on my own. This was mainly because I know that when it came time to do the actual in class WODs, I would have a time limit to complete it. However, at times when I would hit a roadblock, I would utilize ChatGPT to help me understand the task at hand. 
     
  2. In-class Practice WODs: Same as the experience WODs, the WODs in the beginning of the semester, I didn't really rely on AI too much. This is because I wanted to do the WOD based on my own knowledge. Even though I relied on what I already knew, I still used AI a little bit if I didn't understand something.

  3. In-class WODs: At first, I wasn't sure if I could use AI in during the in-class WODs. I'd say for the first half of the WODs, I didn't use AI at all. Towards the 2nd half of the WODs, it began to get more difficult to understand the task at hand, which lead to me using Chat GPT for assistance.

  4. Essays: This is one of the things that I didn't on AI for help at all. The essays that I've written for this class have been always written by me. I only utilized AI for grammar checking, paragraph flow, and help on making good titles/subtitles.

  5. Final project: GitHub Copilot was the main tool that I used because with using VS Code I had easy access to it when coding. I mainly used it for debugging as well as to help me code tasks that I had no idea on where to begin. Another thing was if the task that I had to do was confusing or complex.

  6. Learning a concept / tutorial: When learning a concept/tutorial, I made sure to stay away from using AI at all costs. I knew that using AI when learning a concept would cost me a lot in the long run. Learning on my own without the help of AI made sure that I grasped the foundation of what was being taught.

  7. Answering a question in class or in Discord: I didn't use AI to answer questions in the discord channel. If I were to answer to a question, I would answer the question based on my own knowledge. As for in class, my professor would always encourage us to use AI as one of our resources if we needed help.

  8. Asking or answering a smart-question: When asking or answering a smart-question, I would sometimes answer basic questions. Other than that, I would hardly be active in the #smart-questions channel.

  9. Coding example e.g. “give an example of using Underscore .pluck”: When we started to get into npm, I reached out to Chat GPT more frequently because this was my first time learning about it. This goes for everything that I don't have a prior knowledge about. There were a lot of commands that I wasn't able to memorize, so I relied on Chat GPT heavily for this.

  10. Explaining code: I used Chat GPT a lot when it comes to explaining code because there were a lot of complex topics in software engineering that I learned about for the first time. Having Chat GPT explain the code, helped me understand the code better and what it does.

  11. Writing code: Back when I first started learning how to code, I turned to Chat GPT for help all the time. I didn't have that much experience with coding back then in ICS 111. All the things that I learned back then was all new to me. Athough, I still sometimes struggle with writing code and this is due to the complex topics that are being taught. Now, I mainly rely on Chat GPT to either check my code and to help me debug.

  12. Documenting code: I always had a habit on commenting every line of code I write, so that other people who view my code would have a sense of how my code works. As I moved on in my programming classes, I realized that it's not really necessary to comment on every single line of code. As long as I had the most important lines of code documented, I should be good. I still think it's a good habit to form when writing code, since it gives the person viewing your code, a sense of what your code does.

  13. Quality assurance:
      I know that all of the AI resources that I used aren't always perfect. So with that, when I asked Chat GPT a question as to how to fix my code, I laid out my question to include specifics on what problem that I was dealing with. By doing so, it helped me in getting the most accurate solution possible.

  15. Other uses in ICS 314 not listed: I have listed all of my uses of AI in ICS 314.

## III. Impact on Learning and Understanding

AI has influenced my learning experience a lot and ever since I've used it, it has been pretty helpful to say the least. It has enhanced my understanding of a lot of the software engineering concepts because some of the concepts that were being taught I was seeing for the first time.

## IV. Practical Applications

As for AI outside of ICS 314, it's a useful resource to assist you with brain storming on a project or even to get ideas on a paper. I've utilized Chat GPT for most of my classes to help me whenever I would get stuck or have trouble understanding a concept. 

## V. Challenges and Opportunities

There are challenges when it comes to using AI because it's not always bound to give you the exact solution that you're looking for. For example, I've asked Chat GPT to help me fix a bug in my code and it only gave me more errors after following its steps to fix the solution. So sometimes, it best to not always rely on AI too heavily since it will make mistakes that can do more damage than good.

## VI. Comparative Analysis

With traditional teaching methods and AI-enhanced approaches, I say that it's always best to take your own notes in lecture based classes, as well as getting into the habit of practicing your skills to get better at them. By having AI basically doing everything for you, there isn't a 100% guarantee that you'll get better at that certain skill. Like in Calculus 2, I ended up passing the class purely by practicing problems everyday and not using AI to help me. Some things like that are better off without the use of AI. However, AI can be helpful in some areas, like making a study guide of an upcoming exam, quiz or test. Part of it is just being careful for what you're using AI for.

## VII. Future Considerations

AI is set to play an important role in software engineering by offering learning, real-time feedback, and smarter coding support. In the future, it could adapt to lessons to student needs, stimulate real-world development scenarios, and make learning more effective. Although, there are some limits since using AI can lead to acadmeic dihonesty. AI shouldn't replace what you need to do in order to succeed. It's just there as a resource if you ever need extra assistance when solving a problem. With that being said, you should still stick to your old habits and do the things the way that you normally do things.

## VIII. Conclusion

To wrap this up, using AI in ICS 314 helped me a lot. It saved me a lot of time and assisted me in learning a lot of brand new concepts. With taking this class, it also opened my eyes that using AI to much can also hurt yourself in the long run. Doing most of the work yourself will be more beneficial for you and feel more rewarding.
