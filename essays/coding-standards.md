## The Importance of Coding Standards in Learning a New Language

I believe that coding standards are important when learning a new programming language because they help me develop strong coding habits while eliminating bad ones. When I first started coding, I often focused only on making my code work, without paying much attention to how well-structured or readable it was. 

However, as I gained more experience, I realized that writing clean, maintainable code is just as important as making it function correctly. Following coding standards ensures that my code is not only efficient, but also easy to understand and modify in the future if I ever needed to. 

Tools like ESLint play an important role in this process by helping me form my best habits and helping me avoid common mistakes. With ESLint guiding me, I can ensure that my JavaScript and TypeScript code follows the modern coding standards, which makes my code more professional.

## Code Readability and Team Collaboration

One of the biggest advantages of coding standards is the improvement in code readability. Writing clean and consistent code is a skill that becomes valuable, especially when working in teams. If my code is well-structured and follows a consistent style, my teammates can quickly understand my logic, which makes collaboration more efficient. 

Readable code also makes debugging easier and it can help me or someone else quickly identify potential issues without spending hours trying to decipher messy or inconsistent formatting. 

In a team environment, having everyone follow the same coding standards helps with a better code structure and organization, which leads to more maintainable projects. When code is standardized, my other team members will be able to contribute easier because they can add onto the existing code without struggling to understand different coding styles.


## My Experience Using ESLint

After my first week of using ESLint with VSCode, I have already seen many improvements in my programming assignments. ESLint has become an valuable tool for me because it has helped me catch and fix errors in my JavaScript and TypeScript code before they become major issues. 

In the past, I would sometimes spend a lot of time debugging only to realize that the problem was something as simple as a missing semicolon or an improperly formatted function. With ESLint, these small but frustrating errors are flagged immediately. 

With ESLint, it allows me to correct them as I'm coding. This has helped me reduced the amount of time I spend debugging because I no longer need to sit there and read through lines of code to find minor syntax mistakes or formatting issues. Instead, I can focus more on problem-solving and writing efficient algorithms.


## Debugging and Fixing ESLint Errors

One of the things I appreciate most about ESLint is how user-friendly it is when it comes to fixing errors. The error messages are clear and provide helpful explanations, this makes it easy to understand what went wrong. 

In addition to pointing out mistakes, ESLint also offers suggestions for fixing them, which has been a game-changer in my debugging process. Instead of feeling stuck when I encounter an error, I now have guidance on how to resolve it efficiently. 

However, if I ever struggle with a particularly tricky issue, I use GitHub Copilot as an additional resource to help me troubleshoot and refine my code. The combination of ESLint and GitHub Copilot has improved my development workflow, which allows me to write cleaner and more reliable code with confidence.




## Long term Benefits of Using ESLint

Overall, integrating ESLint into my programming workflow has been a exciting experience. Not only has it helped me write better and more consistent code, but it has also deepened my understanding of JavaScript and TypeScript. 

I now feel more confident in my ability to produce clean, efficient, and error-free code, which is an essential skill for any developer. As I continue to grow as a programmer, I know that maintaining strong coding standards and using tools like ESLint will be help me with improving my skills and writing excellent code.
