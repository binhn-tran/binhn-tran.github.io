## Brief Overview

The database stores 'Ōlelo and English sayings, the English translations and explanations. To implement this, my classmate and I used a AVL tree and an AVL node.

## AVL tree class

The AVLTree class efficiently stores and manages Hawaiian sayings. It makes sure that the tree remains balanced during insertions,  searching for members, finding first and last sayings, and finding the predecessors, as well as the successors.

## AVL node class

The AVLNode class provides efficient storage and retrieval of Hawaiian sayings. 

## Saying class

The Saying class represents the Hawaiian words, their English translation, as well as an explanation.

## Main class

The main class creates a SayingsDatabase object to hold all the sayings managed by the AVL tree. Insert sayings using the insert method along with their translations and explanations. Tests functions by printing the first and last sayings in alphabetical order. Checks if a saying exists in the database. Retrieves and prints the predecessor and successor of a saying. Finds sayings that contain a word in the Hawaiian language. Searches for sayings that contain English words as well.

## Sayings Database class

The sayings database class creates an AVL Tree implementation for the Sayings Database. It stores Hawaiian sayings, their English translations, and explanations, supporting operations like insert, search, and finding predecessors/successors alphabetically.
